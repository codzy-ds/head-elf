# head-elf

This is a simple application to learn React.

The first step is to create a simple application with create-react-app (see ReactApp.md)
and create the different components with React.

Then, by mocking a backend with json-server, create the interactions with the actions (using reflux).

The final step will be to build a backend with exprejs or hapi (not yet decided. But since express is more in usage... )

## Head elf

Christmas time is near, and the season brings the christams elves in Quebec region.

The elves are santa's little helpers that takes a break the month before christmas to come play with the kids.

During the day, they look like dolls. But during the night, they wake up to play tricks.

This application will serve for elves to share their tricks with each others. Because sometime, even santa's elves need a little bit of inspiration.
