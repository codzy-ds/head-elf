This is a simple application to learn React.

The first step is to create a simple application with create-react-app (see ReactApp.md)
and create the different components with React.

Then, by mocking a backend with json-server, create the interactions with the actions (using reflux).

The final step will be to build a backend with exprejs or hapi (not yet decided. But since express is more in usage... )
